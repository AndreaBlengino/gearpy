def add_gear_mating(master: GearBase, slave: GearBase, efficiency: Union[float, int]):
    """Creates a gear mating between two existing gears. This mating is used to compose the mechanical Transmission. \n
    The ratio of the angular speed of the ``master`` gear over the angular speed of the ``slave`` gear is equal to the
    ratio of the ``slave`` gear number of teeth over the ``master`` gear number of teeth. \n
    The ``master`` gear is closest to the motor and transfers a fraction of the driving torque to the ``slave`` one,
    based on the ``efficiency`` value: the higher the ``efficiency``, the higher the fraction of transferred driving
    torque.

    Parameters
    ----------
    master : GearBase
        Driving gear.
    slave : GearBase
        Driven gear.
    efficiency : float or int
        Mechanical efficiency of the gear mating.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        - If ``master`` is not an instance of ``GearBase``,
        - if ``slave`` is not an instance of ``GearBase``,
        - if ``efficiency`` is not a float or an integer.
    ValueError
        If ``efficiency`` is not within ``0`` and ``1``.
